## Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
## head: 
The head command displays the first few lines (by default, the first 10) of a file or the output of a command.

## tail: 
The tail command displays the last few lines (by default, the last 10) of a file or the output of a command. It is often used to monitor log files in real-time.

## find: 
The find command is used to search for files and directories based on various criteria such as name, size, type, and more. It is a powerful tool for locating files within a directory hierarchy.

## wc: 
The wc command is used to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or the output of a command. It stands for "word count."

## sort: 
The sort command is used to sort the lines of a file or the output of a command in ascending or descending order. It can sort based on various criteria, such as numeric or alphabetic order.

## uniq: 
The uniq command filters out adjacent duplicate lines from a sorted file or the output of a command. It is often used in combination with the sort command.

## grep: 
The grep command searches for lines in a file or the output of a command that match a given pattern. It is a powerful tool for pattern matching and text filtering.

## tr: 
The tr command translates or deletes characters from the input. It can be used to transform or replace characters within a file or the output of a command.

Redirecting standard output to a file: To redirect the standard output of a command to a file, you can use the > operator. For example, command > output.txt will redirect the output of command to the file output.txt, overwriting its contents.

Getting standard input from a file: To send standard input to a command from a file instead of the keyboard, you can use the < operator. For example, command < input.txt will use the content of input.txt as the input for command.

Sending output from one program to another: To send the output of one program as input to another program, you can use the | (pipe) operator. For example, command1 | command2 will pass the output of command1 as input to command2.

Combining commands and filters with redirections: You can combine commands and filters with redirections to create powerful data processing pipelines. For example:

command1 | command2: Sends the output of command1 as input to command2.
command1 | sort | uniq > output.txt: Sorts the output of command1, removes duplicate lines, and saves the result in output.txt.
# Special Characters
## White spaces: 
White spaces, including spaces, tabs, and newlines, are used to separate words, arguments, and parameters in command-line interfaces and programming languages. They help in distinguishing between different elements and improve code readability.

## Single quotes (''): 
Single quotes are used to create a string literal in which special characters (except for single quotes themselves) are treated as literal characters. Variable interpolation does not occur within single quotes. For example, echo 'Hello, $USER' will output "Hello, $USER" instead of replacing $USER with the actual user name.

## Double quotes (""): 
Double quotes are used to create a string literal in which variable interpolation and command substitution occur. Special characters within double quotes are interpreted accordingly. For example, echo "Hello, $USER" will output "Hello, <username>" with the actual user name substituted.

## Backslash (): 
The backslash is used as an escape character. It allows you to include special characters literally or suppress their special meanings. For example, echo "This is a \"quote\"" will output "This is a "quote"" with the quotes included as literal characters.

## Comment (#): 
The pound sign or hash symbol is used to indicate comments in many programming languages and configuration files. Anything after a hash symbol on a line is treated as a comment and ignored by the interpreter or compiler.

## Pipe (|): 
The pipe character is used to redirect the output of one command to another as input. It allows you to chain multiple commands together, creating a pipeline for data processing. For example, ls | grep ".txt" will list all files in the current directory and then filter the output to show only files with the ".txt" extension.

## Command separator (;): 
The semicolon character is used as a command separator in many programming languages and shell scripts. It allows you to execute multiple commands on a single line. For example, command1; command2 will execute command1 and then command2 sequentially.

## Tilde (~): 
The tilde character is often used as a shorthand representation of the user's home directory. For example, cd ~ will change the current directory to the user's home directory.
